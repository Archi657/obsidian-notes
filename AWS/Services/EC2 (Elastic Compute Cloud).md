## Key Features

1. **Instance Types**: Variety of instance types for different workloads (e.g., General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized).
2. **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.
3. **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: Persistent storage volumes for EC2 instances.
4. **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances.
5. **Spot Instances**: Cost-effective instances for flexible workloads.

## Real-World Examples

1. **Hosting a Web Application**:
    - **Problem**: A company needs a scalable and cost-efficient solution to host an e-commerce platform.
    - **Solution**: Use EC2 with Auto Scaling to handle traffic spikes, Elastic Load Balancer for traffic distribution, and EBS for persistent storage.
2. **Batch Processing**:
    - **Problem**: A data analytics team processes large datasets but doesn't need to run instances continuously.
    - **Solution**: Use Spot Instances to execute batch jobs at a lower cost and terminate them when jobs are complete.
3. **Development and Testing Environments**:
    - **Problem**: Developers need isolated environments to test applications.
    - **Solution**: Deploy EC2 instances with specific configurations for testing and terminate them after use to save costs.
