AWS Regions are clusters of data centers, they are named like us-east-1, and each has at least 3 AZ (Availability zones)
### How to choose a Region
- **Compliance** with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- **Proximity** to customers: reduced latency
- **Available** services within a Region: new services and new features aren-t available in every Region
- **Pricing**: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in te service pricing page
