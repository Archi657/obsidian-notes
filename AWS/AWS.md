A. Loose coupling: This is a design principle that promotes independence between components in a system. It enhances flexibility and scalability by reducing dependencies. While beneficial for system architecture, it doesn't directly target cost optimization. B. Rightsizing: Involves selecting the appropriate size and type of AWS resources to match the workload's actual needs. The focus is on optimizing costs by avoiding overprovisioning and ensuring resources are efficiently utilized. Regular reviews and adjustments contribute to ongoing cost-effectiveness. C. Caching: Involves storing frequently accessed data to reduce the need to fetch it repeatedly from the original source. It improves performance and can indirectly contribute to cost savings by reducing the load on backend resources. The primary focus, however, is on enhancing application performance rather than direct cost optimization. D. Redundancy: Involves having duplicate components to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. While crucial for reliability and minimizing downtime, redundancy's primary goal is not direct cost optimization. It can prevent costs associated with disruptions and

# Cloud Computing General
Cloud Computing is the **on-demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources. This was born due to the problem of [[1 - IT Overview|Traditional Data Centers Approach]] when speaking of big an scalable companies, where more customers imply more resources. 

Cloud Computing has a lot of advantages:
- Cloud Services with **pay-as-you-go**
- Provision exactly the **right type and size of computing resources** you need
- Access as many resources as you need, **almost instantly**
- Simple way to access **servers, storage, databases** and a set of application services
## Deployment Models of the Cloud

## Private Cloud
e.g. Rackspace

- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public 
- Complete control
- Security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business needs
## Public Cloud
e.g. Azure, Google, AWS

- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
- [[#Six Advantages of Cloud Computing]]
## Hybrid Cloud
e.g. Your own Infra with Cloud, like AWS

- Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud
## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

**On-demand self service:**
- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
**Broad network access:**
- Resources available over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
**Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:**
- Multiple customer can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
- Multiple customer are serviced from the same physical resources
**Rapid elasticity and scalability:**
- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
- Quickly and easily scale based on demand
**Measured service:**
- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what the have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

**Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)**
- Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
**Benefit from massive economies of scale**
- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
**Stop guessing capacity**
- Scale based on actual measured usage
**Increase speed and agility**
- Due to its infrastructure is easy to build and deploy
**Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
- No costs of maintaining
**Go global in minutes**
- Leverage the AWS global infrastructure
## Problems solved by the Cloud

- **Flexibility:** Change resource types when needed
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay as you go, for what you use
- **Scalability:** Accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- **Elasticity:** Ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- **High-availability and fault-tolerance:** Build across data centers
- **Agility:** Rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
