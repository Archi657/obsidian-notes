I hope you can use these notes as a guide to learn/study for the Cloud Practitioner exam.
Once I was able to complete the question's set by kinda only reading the question without even seeing the answers, I knew I was ready. 

Also I would go through every service in the exam guide and make sure I could define it and differentiate it from the others.

Exam Date: 2/11/2025
