**Cloud Computing is the **on-demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources. This was born due to the problem of [[1 - IT Overview|Traditional Data Centers Approach]] when speaking of big an scalable companies, where more customers imply more resources. 

Cloud Computing has a lot of advantages:
- Cloud Services with **pay-as-you-go**
- Provision exactly the **right type and size of computing resources** you need
- Access as many resources as you need, **almost instantly**
- Simple way to access **servers, storage, databases** and a set of application services

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

**On-demand self service:**
- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
**Broad network access:**
- Resources available over the network and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
**Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:**
- Multiple customer can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
- Multiple customer are serviced from the same physical resources
**Rapid elasticity and scalability:**
- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
- Quickly and easily scale based on demand
**Measured service:**
- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what the have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

**Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)**
- Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
**Benefit from massive economies of scale**
- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
**Stop guessing capacity**
- Scale based on actual measured usage
**Increase speed and agility**
- Due to its infrastructure is easy to build and deploy
**Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
- No costs of maintaining
**Go global in minutes**
- Leverage the AWS global infrastructure
## Problems solved by the Cloud

- **Flexibility:** Change resource types when needed
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay as you go, for what you use
- **Scalability:** Accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- **Elasticity:** Ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- **High-availability and fault-tolerance:** Build across data centers
- **Agility:** Rapidly develop, test and launch software applications**
